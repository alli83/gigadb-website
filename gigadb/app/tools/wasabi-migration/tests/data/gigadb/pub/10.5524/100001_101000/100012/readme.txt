Genome-wide patterns of genetic variation in sweet and grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor)

Introducion
Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) is globally produced as a source of food, feed, fibre and fuel. Grain and sweet sorghums differ in a number of important traits including stem sugar and juice accumulation, plant height and production of grain and biomass. The first whole genome sequences of a grain sorghum is available, but additional genome sequences are required to study genome-wide and intraspecific variation for dissecting the genetic basis of these important traits and for tailor-designed breeding of this important C4 crop. We resequenced two sweet and one grain sorghum inbred lines, and identified a set of nearly 1,500 genes differentiating sweet and grain sorghum. These genes fall into 10 major metabolic pathways involved in sugar and starch metabolisms, lignin and coumarin biosynthesis, nucleic acid metabolism, stress responses and DNA damage repair. In addition, we uncovered 1,057,018 SNPs, 99,948 indels of 1-10bp in length and 16,487 presence/absence variations. In addition, 17,111 CNVs were detected. The majority of the SNPs, large-effect SNPs, indels and presence/absence variations resided the genes containing leucine rich repeats, PPR repeats and disease resistance R genes possessing diverse biological functions or under diversifying selection, but were absent in genes which are essential for life. This is a first report on the identification of genome-wide patterns of genetic variation in sorghum. High-density SNP and indel markers reported here will be a valuable resource for future genotype and phenotype studies and the molecular breeding of this important crop and related species.
